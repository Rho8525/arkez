      <!-- <p class="my-2">
        im just an ordinary boy, the last child. from middle to lower family. i
        get to go into highschool while my brothers stop after graduated from
        middle school. i had interest in technologies, it all started because i
        get to borrow a tablet from my brother, i just play games at that time.
        after entering middle school i get my first phone, my parents buy it for
        me because the assignments are send online (covid btw). im just happy
        after getting new phone without knowing that there is more to consider
        when buying device. well, i did regret it but ill just go with it for
        around 4 or 5 years. seeing other childern can play games they want and
        me who got low en phone so damn frustating. so i searched good
        lightweight games, after some times, im thinking of making my own game,
        with phone and only phone. i started making html5 canvas game, following
        tutorials. learning new languages (just to print hello world, it can get
        me so much joy). then lua caught my eyes, i think ive seen lua can be
        used to make games, then i search it and found love2d, basically game
        framework, i tried it. follow tutorials, but there are small amount of
        tutorials about it on youtube. i follow existing tutorials, kinda get
        some progress, and then the part to make the map. i need an aplication
        to make the map that support lua, and that is tiled map editor, which is
        dont exist on phone. so im installing windows emulator, just so i can
        install tiled and continue making my game. long story short i gave up
        because i think its hard to progress not because my device but myself, i
        had no motivation to continue making this game. but i still want to make
        games for fun (its fun when you just created a new project). i have
        known godot exist so i installed godot for android. the ui is hard, but
        it works i guess. then i abandon it all, what i have worked on. i think
        its my second year in highschool that i got my second phone, more decent
        than the first, could have been better actually. i turn around my
        learning to web development. installing termux, focus on learning
        certain languages like javascript, typescript, c++, and python. on my
        third year of highschool, i got my first laptop. its my first time so...
        i regret it like when i first get a phone. so i just had to go with it
        for now, because the story end and im still learning new things. its
        hard to do what you want if you dont get the right tools, but hard
        doesnt mean impossible, just mean more troublemsome things to deal. im
        not smart, but people tend to eexpect too much from me. i act like a
        fool and i cant deny that im really are. and i dont even know whats the
        right option to choose. im thinking if it would be better if i choose
        the other option. actually, if i want to say it shortly, im lost from
        the stright way, im a stray that can go back but hesitated. anyway,
        thats all, im a lazy guy after all. i need to work on myself more
        actually.

      <p class="my-2">
        I'm just an ordinary guy, the youngest of the family. My brothers all
        stopped their education after middle school, but I was lucky enough to
        be the only one who got to go to high school. My interest in technology
        started with a tablet my brother let me borrow. At first, I just played
        games on it. Then, when I started middle school, my parents bought me my
        very first phone for online assignments during COVID. I was so happy,
        but I quickly realized I didn't know what to look for in a device. It
        was a low-end phone, and I regretted it almost instantly. It was
        frustrating seeing other kids play the games they wanted while my phone
        struggled. That frustration pushed me to search for lightweight games.
        After a while, I thought, "Why not make my own?" I decided to try
        creating games on my phone using HTML5 Canvas, following tutorials
        online. Learning new languages, even just to print "Hello, world,"
        brought me so much joy. Then I discovered Lua and the Love2D game
        framework. I started following tutorials, but there weren't many
        available on YouTube. I made some progress, but then I hit a wall: I
        needed a map editor called Tiled, which wasn't available on phones. To
        keep going, I installed a Windows emulator just so I could run the
        program. Long story short, I eventually gave up. I felt like the problem
        wasn't my device, but me. I lost my motivation to continue. But I still
        wanted to make games for fun, even if it was just starting a new
        project. I heard about Godot and installed the Android version, but the
        user interface was so difficult on a phone. I eventually abandoned all
        the projects I had worked on. In my second year of high school, I got a
        new, more decent phone. I switched my focus to web development, using an
        app called Termux to learn languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, C++,
        and Python. Then, in my third year, I got my first laptop. Just like
        with my first phone, I immediately regretted the choice. But I have to
        stick with it for now, and I'm still learning new things. It's hard to
        do what you want if you don't have the right tools, but "hard" doesn't
        mean "impossible." It just means there are more obstacles to overcome. I
        don't think I'm smart, but people often expect a lot from me. I feel
        like a fool, and I can't deny that I probably am. I often wonder if I
        should have made different choices. To be honest, I feel lost. Like I've
        strayed from the right path, and I'm hesitant to go back. I know I'm
        lazy, and I need to work on myself more.
      </p>

        i know there are people suffering more than me, that's why i will start
        to be grateful for what i have, from now on until i die. and i hope i can be any of
        help to those people in needs before the world ends.
