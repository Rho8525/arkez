      <p class="my-2">
        im just an ordinary boy, the last child. from middle to lower family. i
        get to go into highschool while my brothers stop after graduated from
        middle school. i had interest in technologies, it all started because i
        get to borrow a tablet from my brother, i just play games at that time.
        after entering middle school i get my first phone, my parents buy it for
        me because the assignments are send online (covid btw). im just happy
        after getting new phone without knowing that there is more to consider
        when buying device. well, i did regret it but ill just go with it for
        around 4 or 5 years. seeing other childern can play games they want and
        me who got low en phone so damn frustating. so i searched good
        lightweight games, after some times, im thinking of making my own game,
        with phone and only phone. i started making html5 canvas game, following
        tutorials. learning new languages (just to print hello world, it can get
        me so much joy). then lua caught my eyes, i think ive seen lua can be
        used to make games, then i search it and found love2d, basically game
        framework, i tried it. follow tutorials, but there are small amount of
        tutorials about it on youtube. i follow existing tutorials, kinda get
        some progress, and then the part to make the map. i need an aplication
        to make the map that support lua, and that is tiled map editor, which is
        dont exist on phone. so im installing windows emulator, just so i can
        install tiled and continue making my game. long story short i gave up
        because i think its hard to progress not because my device but myself, i
        had no motivation to continue making this game. but i still want to make
        games for fun (its fun when you just created a new project). i have
        known godot exist so i installed godot for android. the ui is hard, but
        it works i guess. then i abandon it all, what i have worked on. i think
        its my second year in highschool that i got my second phone, more decent
        than the first, could have been better actually. i turn around my
        learning to web development. installing termux, focus on learning
        certain languages like javascript, typescript, c++, and python. on my
        third year of highschool, i got my first laptop. its my first time so...
        i regret it like when i first get a phone. so i just had to go with it
        for now, because the story end and im still learning new things. its
        hard to do what you want if you dont get the right tools, but hard
        doesnt mean impossible, just mean more troublemsome things to deal. im
        not smart, but people tend to eexpect too much from me. i act like a
        fool and i cant deny that im really are. and i dont even know whats the
        right option to choose. im thinking if it would be better if i choose
        the other option. actually, if i want to say it shortly, im lost from
        the stright way, im a stray that can go back but hesitated. anyway,
        thats all, im a lazy guy after all. i need to work on myself more
        actually.
